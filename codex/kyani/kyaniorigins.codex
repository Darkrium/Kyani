		"Kyani are a peaceful race and normally hold life and peace above all else. They have traveled through many universes in search of a safe haven and yet their true origins are unknown even to most of themselves.",

		"The true size of a kyani towers over all others and for this reason they adjust their size to match others to make them feel more comfortable with their presence. Kyani also normally can't exist with other species because of their composition, but with some augments it was made possible for the kyani to not to emit radiation and to consume food made of organic elements and water."

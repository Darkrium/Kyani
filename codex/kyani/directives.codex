		"If you read this, then you belong to our mission to make colonies and spread peace everywhere. Whenever it's a barren planet or a thriving world. Here are the directives you shall follow. Violating at least one of them will lead to your disqualification.
		1 - Do not use violence often. Only if the situation requres it and peaceful means of solving the conflict didn't help.
    2 - Value life above anything else. After all, it's the goal Gaian gave us.
    3 - Never betray the truth. Liars are never appreciated.
    4 - Always be kind and cheerful. This will make things easier for everyone.
    5 - Never violate the laws of other countries. If you do we'll be unable to protect you from their judgement.
    6 - Never be afraid to call for help. Solving everything alone isn't as easy as it may seem.
    7 - Remember that we care about you!"

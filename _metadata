  "description" : "You wonder what those unusual big fluff balls are? They are kyani!\nKyani are species unlike others. They never showed their true origins, it is only known that their home planet is anomaly-planet Juronia.\n\nKyani are composed of metals, mercury, radioactive elements, love and cuteness. Their tech is far ahead of any others', but they don't wanna share it. Nobody wants to be blamed for the end of the world, right?\n\nKyani are scientists and crafters. They focus on creatively crafting stuff and making this as best as possible. They also reached a scientific breakthrough and obtained a proto-material - anophium. Shortly, everything is made out of it and everything can be turned into it. It's also an excellent fuel source and is valuable.\n\nWanna contact the authors?\nDiscord -Khaviya \"Basileia\" Byzantinos#6219 and Darkrium#0458\nDiscord Server invite - https://discord.gg/wuPwd9u\n\nP.S.
